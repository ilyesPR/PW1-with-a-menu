# Notes :
For anyone using Cote::Blocks on windows and using MinGW GCC, if codeblocks launches an error when you compile, go to : Settings-->Complier..-->Linker Settings-->Other linker options--> and write -lwinmm.

For those on linux where r yall even here

I linked a version without the PlaySound() function this time so that those who can't get the function to work can use the program normally

I should note that the solutions to the tasks aren't 100% accurate because I added a little bit of my special touch to it

For anyone that wants to use the code or anything that I've done go for it
